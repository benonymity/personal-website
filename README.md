# Personal Website

Huge thanks to all the visual groundwork for this site laid by the [vcard-portfolio-website](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) repository!

I love elegant things, and while I could have used some up and coming framework, I wanted to keep this as simple as possible while still maintaining an aesthetic design. Pure HTML and CSS it is, with only a few lines of vanilla JS to handle multiple pages in one file. As straightforward as it gets! Enjoy poking around.
