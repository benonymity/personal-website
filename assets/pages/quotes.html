      <a href="https://youtu.be/KAmEsI8f0es" target="_blank">I like words.</a>
      Here are a few of my favorites. <br /><br />
      If you've come from a link, it's probably because I'm too indecisive to
      pick just one quote in some profile description, so why not just link to
      hundreds of options? ;) <br /><br />
      I am
      <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/" target="_blank"
        >someone who is upset by an uncited quote</a
      >, so I've tried to give proper attribution here, but occasionally
      tracking down a source requires more time than I'm willing to invest. Let
      me know if you know where an unmarked quote comes from! <br /><br />
      If you're looking for some good quotes, the
      <a

        >Oxford References</a

      are very well done, with thorough citations (unlike
      <a href="https://brainyquote.com" target="_blank">some websites...</a>)
      and division by subject and author. The

      are wonderful to explore, highly recommend!

              It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but
              just as much to stand up to our friends.

              It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best
              suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who,
              like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle
              because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear
              it well.

              Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on
              earth should that mean that it is not real?
